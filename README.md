# Song Guessing Game
It's a little game that plays a random fragment from a random song and the user has to guess within 10 seconds to earn a point.

As it's currently implemented, one has to guess the name of the filename of the song, so I rename the filenames to match the names of the songs without extensions or anything.

You can add the path of multiple folders with songs in the FOLDERS variable.

It has a bunch of dependencies like "play" and GNU core utils.

I used it to guess God Is An Astronaut's songs. Check them out, they are amazing.
